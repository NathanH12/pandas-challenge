Summary: In this analysis, I examined the performance of students of different schools based on various components such as school spending, school size, and school type. As I analyzed these factors, I observed how they may or may not impact academic performance by students.
Conclusions: One conclusion that could be drawn by looking at this data set would be that school spending did not equal academic success. Some schools that spent more per student ended up having lower testing scores while some schools that spent less per student had highher student scores.
Another conclusion is that charter schools outperformed district schools based on testing performance. Charter schools outperformed district schools in all three tested subjects and were especially dominant in Math.
