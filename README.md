I used AskBCS Learning Assistant three times. Once to help fix an error with my bins. I was getting huge numbers and we found an error. Another time they helped me figure out the I needed to use school_data_comoplete instead of school_data. And another person helped me add "School Type" to my per_school_summary, which was causing an error in the final section.
I used chatgpt to fix dozens of errors throughout the assignment.
